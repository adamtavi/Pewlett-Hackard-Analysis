# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Project Overview
Purpose of this assignment is to assist with analyzing a companyâ€™s employee data to determine the number of retiring employees per title and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program.

## Analysis

### Retiring Employees per Title
- People with the job titles Senior Engineers and Senior Staff have the highest count of upcoming retiree's which makes sense given their senior job titles.
- Technical leaders and Assistnant Engineers had a much lower count of upcoming retiree's and potential promotions can be a solution to counter high retirment rates amongst senior leaders.

### Mentorship Program Eligibility
- A total of 1549 employees who are eligible for the mentoship program.
- There are 422 Senior Staff Members and 296 Senior Engineers who are eligible for the menorship program.

## Conclusion
- As the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact there are 90,398 roles that need to be filled.
- No there are not enough employees eligible for the mentorship program to mentor the next generation.

### Two additional tables that could provide more insight:
-  A table that show's retiring employee's by department to show what departments are losing the most employees and can help distinguish which department is a priority.
-  A table that show's how many people are not retiring to show how many need to be mentored.
